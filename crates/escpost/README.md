# escpost

`escpost` is a command-line toolbox for rendering, inspecting, capturing, and
printing ESC/POS jobs. It can render raw bytes or readable hexadecimal input to
PNG, provide a live browser preview, act as a virtual RAW TCP printer, and send
jobs to USB or network printers.

```console
escpost render receipt.hex --profile REFERENCE --output receipt.png
```

See the [CLI reference](https://github.com/receiptful/escpost/blob/main/docs/CLI.md)
for commands, input formats, output modes, and automation behavior.
